Samsung Notes no longer runs on non-Galaxy Book Laptops anymore after a recent update (v4.3.181.0) via Microsoft Store on Windows 11. There are 2 solutions that can be done to mitigate this issue, you may try either one. Please don't mix the 2 solutions together.

Solution 1: YOU CAN UPDATE VIA MICROSOFT STORE or install with winget. Run the .bat file (you can download below), this will change the bios model number and manufacturer to one of Samsung's devices (laptop) which will allow Samsung Notes to run without any restrictions. Thanks to u/hedehede81 for the solution! Quote original message.THIRD PARTY ANTIVIRUS APPLICATION WILL DETECT THE .BAT FILES AS A RISK, IT IS A FALSE POSITIVE DETECTION! Check the script yourself, nothing odd is inside! Whitelist it. or manually edit the registry yourself!

PS, the .bat will run on every startup, admin permission will come up, yes=if u want to use Samsung Notes, no=if you don't want to use it. If you accidentally click on no, just run the script yourself whenever you want.
